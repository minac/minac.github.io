      <description>Welcome! This blog has had several iterations over the years. Most of its life was in a self hosted WordPress, a bit in Anchor, a bit in Ghost and finally in Medium. As the continuous experiment that it is, now it&amp;rsquo;s a mix of Jekyll and Github Pages fronted by the amazing Cloudflare. It&amp;rsquo;s fun and easy to blog again and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay anyone to host me, so expect a bunch of small posts coming up!</description>
